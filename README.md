## The Quote

> “Their morals, their 'code'; it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see-- I'll show you: when the chips are down these, uh, civilized people?, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve.”
